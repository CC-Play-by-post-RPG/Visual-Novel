* Go to http://www.renpy.org/latest.html and download and extract the SDK.
* Open renpy (the program you just extracted) and create a new project.
* Locate the project folder and go into the "game" folder.
* Delete everything in the "game" folder (which should be your curent folder).
* Clone this git repository into the "game" folder using your prefered method (command line or [gui](https://desktop.github.com/)).
* Git may make a folder to clone everything into, when it finishes cloning simply copy everything out and into the game folder and delete the (now) empty folder which git created. You may need to tell your file browser to show hidden files so that you can copy the .git folder too. If you are using github's gui you will need to tell it that you moved the repo.
